## Hello!

### Welcome to my website used for the course 1dv022

My name is Stefan and i am 27 years old. I live in Kalmar, Sweden and i am currently studying 
_Utveckling och drift av mjukvarusystem_ at Linnaeus University, Kalmar.

This website was made using Jekyll.

The layout you are seeing now was made by playing around and building upon the default _minima_ theme that was included
in the Jekyll template. The end result is this sort of _hacker-typewriter_-esque style wich i find kind of cool.
