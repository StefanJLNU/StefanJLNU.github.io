_Open Graph_ is a protocoll that determines what information is shown when websites are linked on a social media platform.
I've configured it by adding meta tags to my _"head.html"_-file in the _includes directory.

The tags i added determines the information on _title_, _image_, _type_ and _url_ that will show up when the website is linked.
