Static Site Generators are a great tool when you quickly need a website up and running, or if you need to test some feature/code in a _"Semi-real"_ enviroment.
The biggest con _(that i've noticed at least, using Jekyll)_ is that it takes a fair ammount of playing around and testing stuff to really understand how things work, what files go _where_, and what you _can_ and _cannot_ do.

### What type of projects are they suitable for?

Smaller websites, e.g. blogs or portfolio-esque sites, since these kind of projects usually are "static" and don't need content that dynamicly updates or _"refreshes"_.
