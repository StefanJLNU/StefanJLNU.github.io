### Compare to regular CSS

The biggest difference to me is being able to use variables in my code, and that i can have nested styles
within other styles.
This makes it so much easier to structure the code and also greatly improves _readability_.

### Wich techniques did you use?

Other than nesting and using variables, i also used some built-in functions for adjusting color settings,
e.g. the _darken()_ and _lighten()_ functions.

### Pros and cons?

The only cons i've experienced so far is that it is a bit more tedious to debug code, since the line numbers in error messages doesn't correspond to the actual line numbers in the files you are working with.
_But_ in my opinion, the advantages outweighs the disadvantages in this case. Being able to use variables and nested styles greatly facilitates the development process when working with CSS code.
